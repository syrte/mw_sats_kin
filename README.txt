This repository includes four table files

- mw_profile.txt
    Inferred MW mass profile.

- mw_profile_covariance.txt
    Covariance matrix of the inferred MW mass profile.

- mw_satellite_kinematics.txt
    MW satellite kinematic data, including the original measurements and the posterior kinematics.
    The latter presents a more precise estimate of kinematics for those satellites with uncertain measurements.

- mw_satellite_kinematics_weighted_sample.txt
    Monte Carlo sample of the MW satellite kinematics.
    Along with the importance weight, this sample represents weighted realizations of the posterior kinematics for MW satellites.

The above tables are also available in the compressed file mw_profile+satkin.zip

The data has been assigned a doi 10.12149/101018
