This repository includes four table files

- mw_profile.txt
    Inferred MW mass profile.

- mw_profile_covariance.txt
    Covariance matrix of the inferred MW mass profile.

- mw_satellite_kinematics.txt
    MW satellite kinematic data, including the original measurements and the posterior kinematics.
    The latter presents a more precise estimate of kinematics for those satellites with uncertain measurements.

- mw_satellite_kinematics_weighted_sample.txt
    Monte Carlo sample of the MW satellite kinematics.
    Along with the importance weight, this sample represents a weighted realizations of the posterior kinematics for MW satellites.

The above tables are also available in the compressed file mw_profile+satkin.zip
